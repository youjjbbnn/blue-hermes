# Hermes v2026.9.21 requires a SQLite build without the upstream WAL-reset

# freshly-created state.db. Build the same pinned SQLite release and feature

# Install hermes-agent (provides the `hermes` CLI) and pre-build its React
# dashboard so `hermes dashboard` has nothing to build at runtime.
#
# [all] in v2026.6.5 no longer pulls in [dev]; messaging platforms, TTS, and
# other heavy backends are lazy-installed by hermes at first use. We pre-install
# the ones this template actually uses so first-message latency is instant.
# `vision` guards image downscaling (without Pillow an oversized image >5 MB /
# >8000px bakes into immutable history and bricks the session on Anthropic's
# non-retryable 400). The extra itself has been EMPTY since v2026.6.19 — Pillow
# moved into core deps — so it resolves to a no-op; kept for back-compat.
# When bumping HERMES_REF, re-check hermes-agent's pyproject.toml [all] and
# the extras below against the new release's pyproject.toml.
#
# The `-e` is LOAD-BEARING since v2026.8.3: upstream's new setup.py raises on
# bdist_wheel/sdist unless HERMES_NIX_BUILD=1. PEP 660 editable installs route
# through build_editable and are exempt — drop `-e` and the image won't build.
#
# v2026.8.3 also added [tool.uv] to pyproject.toml, which uv reads from this
# cwd (upstream builds from a frozen lock; we re-resolve every time):
# override-dependencies fixes discord.py's vulnerable pynacl pin, and
# exclude-newer="14 days" can fail a build on a fresh dep — override with
# `uv pip install --exclude-newer <date>`.
#
# v2026.8.13 made that escape hatch sharper, and v2026.9.11 moved the floor
# again: nemo-relay is now >=0.8.3,<0.9 (0.8.3 published 2026-09-02), which
# only resolves because upstream lists it in exclude-newer-package. A manual
# `--exclude-newer <date>` re-imposes a GLOBAL cutoff, so any date before
# 2026-09-02 leaves nemo-relay>=0.8.3 unsatisfiable and hard-fails the build.
# Same trap for cryptography==50.0.0 and h2 4.4.1. Re-read this floor on every
# bump — it tracks whatever nemo-relay pin the pinned tag carries.

# Why pre-build ui-tui (and why we don't delete it after):
# - The dashboard's embedded Chat tab spawns `node ui-tui/dist/entry.js`
#   on every WebSocket connect to /api/pty.
# - Without HERMES_TUI_DIR, hermes's _make_tui_argv falls through to the
#   npm install + build path (since git-editable installs don't have the
#   bundled tui_dist/ that PyPI wheels include), adding 30-60s to the
#   first chat-open and blocking the asyncio event loop.
# - Pre-building at image time surfaces build failures here rather than
#   at user request time, and makes first-chat-open instant.
# - We keep ui-tui/ entirely (node_modules + dist + src) so HERMES_TUI_DIR
#   can point at it (see below).

# Stamp the CODE-SCOPED install method next to the running package. hermes'
# detect_install_method() reads <install-tree>/.install_method FIRST (priority 1,
# authoritative) — before the home-scoped $HERMES_HOME/.install_method that
# start.sh writes (priority 2, honored only when is_container() is true). The
# install tree for our editable install is /opt/hermes-agent (parent of
# hermes_cli/, i.e. Path(config.py).parent.parent). Baking the stamp here makes
# the dashboard "Update Hermes" button refuse regardless of runtime container
# detection — exactly what upstream's own published image does (it bakes a
# docker stamp into /opt/hermes). Belt-and-suspenders with start.sh's home stamp:
# if a future hermes release changes or drops is_container()'s Railway marker
# (/run/.containerenv), the home stamp would stop being honored but this one
# still refuses. Re-verify the install-tree path if hermes stops installing
# editable from /opt/hermes-agent.

# firecrawl-anydoc (the PDF / legacy-Office reader behind read_file) is a CORE
# dependency as of v2026.8.31 — pyproject.toml pins ==0.2.4 and exempts it from
# [tool.uv] exclude-newer, so the main install above already has it.
#
# Do NOT re-pin it in a later layer. We used to (==0.1.6, when it was lazy-only):
# that layer runs AFTER the editable install and uv DOWNGRADES the core version,
# and v2026.8.31 also bumped the lazy self-heal pin (tools/lazy_deps.py
# "tool.doc_extract") to ==0.2.4. _is_satisfied() compares versions, not
# presence, so the first PDF read tries to heal into HERMES_LAZY_INSTALL_TARGET
# with a --constraint file built from every installed dist — which pins
# firecrawl-anydoc==0.1.6 — and uv hard-fails "No solution found". Result:
# EVERY PDF/.docx/.xlsx/.pptx/.odt/.rtf/.epub read fails, on every deploy,
# retried every 300s (ANYDOC_RETRY_SECONDS) and never succeeding.
#
# Same trap for any other package we might pin separately: on a version bump,
# grep the new pyproject's core dependencies for anything this Dockerfile pins.
