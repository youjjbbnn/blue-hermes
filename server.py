Blue Hermes — Railway admin server.

This template is named Blue Hermes; the agent it deploys is upstream Hermes
Agent (https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent), which stays unchanged.

Responsibilities:
  - Admin UI / setup wizard at /setup (Starlette + Jinja, cookie-auth guarded)
  - Management API at /setup/api/* (config, status, logs, gateway, pairing)
  - Reverse proxy at / and /* → native Hermes dashboard (hermes_cli/web_server, on 127.0.0.1:9119)
  - Managed subprocesses: `hermes gateway` (agent) and `hermes dashboard` (native UI)
  - Cookie-based session auth at /login (HMAC-signed, 7-day expiry, httponly)

Auth model: Basic Auth was dropped in favor of cookies because the Hermes React
SPA's plain fetch() calls do not reliably include basic-auth creds across browsers,
and basic-auth's per-directory protection space forced separate prompts for
/setup and /. Cookies auto-include on every same-origin request, so both the
setup UI and the proxied dashboard work with a single login. The cookie signing
secret is regenerated on every process start, so any ADMIN_PASSWORD change on
Railway (which triggers a redeploy) invalidates all existing sessions.

First-visit behavior: if no provider+model config exists, GET / redirects to /setup.
Once configured, / proxies to the Hermes dashboard. A small "← Setup" widget is
injected into every proxied HTML response so users can always return to the wizard.

    refuses every NEW gateway turn, cron dispatch and kanban dispatch with
    "⏸️ Hermes is paused" — but the process stays alive, so `/health` keeps
    returning 200, `gateway_state.json` still reads "running" and the platform
    still shows the bot online. Without this check the admin panel would show a
    green, healthy deployment while the bot answers nothing.

    Two details make it worse than an ordinary setting, and are why this is
    surfaced rather than ignored: the sentinel lives on the Railway volume, so
    it SURVIVES a redeploy (the reflexive "just redeploy" fix does not clear
    it), and `/pause` is `gateway_only` with no owner gate, so any paired
    messaging user can engage it — it is not necessarily operator-driven.

    Upstream's fail-SAFE bias is copied deliberately: an unreadable sentinel
    counts as paused. Failing open here would report "running" for exactly the

# to bring it back; verified it takes the exit-75 path, NOT a detached
# self-restart, when /run/.containerenv or /.dockerenv exists), a crash, or an
# OOM kill — server.py is that supervisor and must restart it. Nothing else
# will, and /health stays 200, so the bot would otherwise sit silently dead.
# A crash-loop guard stops us hammering a gateway that genuinely can't stay up
# (e.g. a bad provider key / model).

# The window above only ever sees loops FASTER than itself: a failure cycle
# longer than RESPAWN_WINDOW_S / RESPAWN_MAX_IN_WIN (~24s) drops its own history
# on the next prune, so the counter never reaches the threshold and the guard
# never fires. v2026.9.11 made that reachable: hermes_startup_watchdog.py (new)
# os._exit(75)s a gateway that hasn't reached a live event loop in 300s, which
# is a ~5-minute cycle — the bot never answers, /health stays 200, and the only
# symptom is one log line every 5 minutes, forever. Upstream hit the same shape
# and says so in gateway/restart_loop_guard.py: "A fixed-window prune only sees
# cycles faster than the window (a slower loop drops its history every boot and
# never trips)". So we also CHAIN exits that are close together AND short-lived.
# Both conditions matter: the gap bound keeps unrelated failures days apart from
# chaining, and the uptime bound means a gateway that actually served for a
# while (an in-band /restart, say) breaks the chain instead of extending it.

class Dashboard:
    """Manages the `hermes dashboard` subprocess (native Hermes web UI).

    Bound to loopback only — we expose it to the public internet through our
    reverse proxy on $PORT, where edge basic auth guards every request.
    The dashboard is independent of the gateway: it reads config files
    directly and tolerates a stopped gateway.

    Spawned with the same merged env (OS env + HERMES_HOME + .env contents)
    as the gateway — see build_hermes_env(). Without it, the dashboard process
    only ever sees our own os.environ from container boot, before any
    provider key exists; the embedded Chat tab's agent-init then fails with
    "No inference provider configured" even though /setup shows a key saved,
    because hermes' own provider auto-resolution (hermes_cli/auth.py) reads
    credentials via plain os.getenv(), not by re-parsing .env from disk. Since
    the dashboard only starts once at boot, restart() must be called whenever
    a provider key is saved so the running process picks up the new env.

    All subprocess output is streamed to our stdout (→ Railway logs) with a
    `[dashboard]` prefix AND retained in a ring buffer for diagnostics.
    Unexpected exits are explicitly logged with their return code.

    use — instead of us hand-writing config.yaml's model block. Hermes always
    resolves an EXPLICIT provider there (never "auto") and correctly clears
    stale base_url/api_key only on a genuine provider switch, preserving them
    on a same-provider re-pick.

    Necessary because our own /setup wizard has a single shared "LLM Model"
    field across every configured provider: once 2+ provider keys exist in
    .env, config.yaml's model.provider="auto" (write_config_yaml()'s old
    unconditional default) lets hermes resolve to the WRONG provider — the
    first match in its own internal PROVIDER_REGISTRY dict order — paired
    with a model string that belongs to a DIFFERENT provider.

    base_url/api_key are forwarded verbatim into this same request's own
    ``base_url``/``api_key`` fields (hermes_cli/web_server.py's
    ``ModelAssignment`` schema — "Only honored for custom/local providers on
    the main slot"). REQUIRED for provider_id="custom": hermes' actual
    runtime resolver (hermes_cli/runtime_provider.py, what the gateway/Chat
    tab call at agent-init) only trusts a bare "custom" provider when
    model.base_url is ALSO set directly on the model block — it never
    consults config.yaml's separate custom_providers[] list (that's
    display/bookkeeping only, for hermes' own Keys-tab picker). Passing them
    lets hermes write model.base_url/model.api_key itself; it also
    auto-registers a matching custom_providers catalog entry as a side
    effect, mirroring its own dashboard's custom-endpoint flow.

    Best-effort: on any failure (dashboard not up yet, network hiccup, no
    session token obtainable) we leave whatever write_config_yaml() already
    wrote in place (single-provider "auto" default, or a previously-pinned

# ── Pairing ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Pending-request file format (hermes >= v0.15 / v2026.5.29.x, gateway/pairing.py):
# each `{platform}-pending.json` entry is keyed by a random opaque `entry_id`
# (secrets.token_hex), and the user-facing pairing code is stored only as a
# salted hash ({hash, salt, user_id, user_name, created_at}) — the plaintext
# code is never on disk. Our admin-approval flow is code-agnostic: the dashboard
# is already cookie-authed, so we approve by moving an entry from pending →
# approved keyed off that `entry_id` (round-tripped from the pending list as
# `code`), reading `user_id`/`user_name` straight from the entry. We must NOT
# uppercase that key — entry_ids are lowercase hex, and uppercasing them was
# what silently broke approve/deny on the v0.15 upgrade. Older plaintext-keyed
# entries still work here because we treat the key as an opaque handle.

# `hermes tools post-setup <key>` in the background whenever that toolset's
# provider has a post_setup hook with an UNSATISFIED install-state predicate.
# Today `_POST_SETUP_INSTALLED` (hermes_cli/tools_config.py) holds exactly one
# entry — cua_driver, i.e. Computer Use — but upstream documents that dict as a
# list to extend, so this will grow silently on future bumps. Re-verified on
# v2026.8.31: still just cua_driver. Do not confuse it with `_POST_SETUP_READY`
# in the same file, which DID gain entries (lightpanda) — that one only gates an
# interactive `hermes tools` prompt and never runs from an HTTP request.
#
# This is log-only, deliberately: unlike the two POST paths, we do NOT inject a
# confirm() here. The existing notice says the install is wiped on redeploy,
# and for cua_driver that is probably FALSE — its installer targets
# ~/.local/bin, and the Dockerfile sets HOME=/data, so it most likely lands on
# the Railway volume and survives (same reasoning that keeps
# POST /api/mcp/catalog/install deliberately uncovered). Telling the user their
# install is about to vanish when it will not is worse than staying quiet, so
# we take the log line — which is what was actually missing — and skip the
